# Pneumonia Detection

Our goal for this project is to classify and train a convoluted neural network (CNN) model to predict if an x-ray image is of lungs with pneumonia or normal.

## Project Goal and Background

We used the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining(CRISP-DM) approach to this project. 

### Business Understanding: 

According to [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204), "Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia." Particularly for children, pneumonia can be very dangerous. 

"Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in children worldwide. Every year, it kills an estimated 1.4 million children under the age of five years, accounting for 18% of all deaths of children under five years old worldwide." These statistics from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/news_events/news/2011/pneumonia/en/) show the importance of accurately diagnosing the infection. 

### Data Understanding:

The dataset is comprised of greyscale x-ray images of pediatric patients. Within these, 1,583 show normal lungs, and 4,273 show lungs with pneumonia. The original dataset comes from Kermany et al. on [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2). Due to the large size of the Mendeley dataset and the computational time to run several models on home computers, we have opted to use the paired down dataset that can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) for proof of concept.
